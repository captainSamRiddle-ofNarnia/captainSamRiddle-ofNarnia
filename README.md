- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @captainSamRiddle-ofNarnia

Hi, I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently working as a solutions engineer for a product based company ( not trying to be ungrateful or anything but ...) with over 3 years of experience living in a delusion that my work is making an impact in the world ( spoiler alert - it's not). So, here I am trying to provide a cheat sheet ( helping material wink wink ) for Leetcode questions, and on the side, do some weekend projects whenever I am not busy doing:
i) Contemplating my life choices 
ii) Feeling bad for myself for not making as a Software Engineer till now
And last but definitely not the least
iii) Living crazy and unrealistic scenarios in my head while watching and judging people on the outside (Trust me it is not as insane as it sounds, in fact it's actually very fun)
